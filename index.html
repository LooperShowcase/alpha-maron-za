    <h3>Microsoft Corporation</h3>
    <p>
      Microsoft Corporation, leading developer of personal-computer software
      systems and applications. The company also publishes books and multimedia
      titles, produces its own line of hybrid tablet computers, offers e-mail
      services, and sells electronic game systems and computer peripherals
      (input/output devices). It has sales offices throughout the world. In
      addition to its main research and development centre at its corporate
      headquarters in Redmond, Washington, U.S., Microsoft operates research
      labs in Cambridge, England (1997); Beijing, China (1998); Bengaluru, India
      (2005); Cambridge, Massachusetts (2008); New York, New York (2012); and
      Montreal, Canada (2015).

    <h3>Founding and early growth</h3>
    <p>
      In 1975 Bill Gates and Paul G. Allen, two boyhood friends from Seattle,
      converted BASIC, a popular mainframe computer programming language, for
      use on an early personal computer (PC), the Altair. Shortly afterward,
      Gates and Allen founded Microsoft, deriving the name from the words
      microcomputer and software. During the next few years, they refined BASIC
      and developed other programming languages. In 1980 International Business
      Machines Corporation (IBM) asked Microsoft to produce the essential
      software, or operating system, for its first personal computer, the IBM
      PC. Microsoft purchased an operating system from another company, modified
      it, and renamed it MS-DOS (Microsoft Disk Operating System). MS-DOS was
      released with the IBM PC in 1981. Thereafter, most manufacturers of
      personal computers licensed MS-DOS as their operating system, generating
      vast revenues for Microsoft; by the early 1990s it had sold more than 100
      million copies of the program and defeated rival operating systems such as
      CP/M, which it displaced in the early 1980s, and later IBM OS/2. Microsoft
      deepened its position in operating systems with Windows, a graphical user
      interface whose third version, released in 1990, gained a wide following.
      By 1993, Windows 3.0 and its subsequent versions were selling at a rate of
      one million copies per month, and nearly 90 percent of the world’s PCs ran
      on a Microsoft operating system. In 1995 the company released Windows 95,
      which for the first time fully integrated MS-DOS with Windows and
      effectively matched in ease of use Apple Computer’s Mac OS. Microsoft also
      became the leader in productivity software such as word-processing and
      spreadsheet programs, outdistancing longtime rivals Lotus and WordPerfect
      in the process. Microsoft dramatically expanded its electronic publishing
      division, created in 1985 and already notable for the success of its
      multimedia encyclopaedia, Encarta. It also entered the information
      services and entertainment industries with a wide range of products and
      services, most notably the Microsoft Network and MSNBC (a joint venture
      with the National Broadcasting Company, a major American television
      network, which began in 1995 and ended in 2012). As a result, by the
      mid-1990s Microsoft, which became a publicly owned corporation in 1986,
      had become one of the most powerful and profitable companies in American
      history. It consistently earned profits of 25 cents on every sales dollar,
      an astonishing record. In the company’s 1996 fiscal year, it topped $2
      billion in net income for the first time, and its unbroken string of
      profits continued, even during the Great Recession of 2007–09 (its net
      income had grown to more than $14 billion by fiscal year 2009). However,
      its rapid growth in a fiercely competitive and fast-changing industry
      spawned resentment and jealousy among rivals, some of whom complained that
      the company’s practices violated U.S. laws against unfair competition.
      Microsoft and its defenders countered that, far from stifling competition
      and technical innovation, its rise had encouraged both and that its
      software had consistently become less expensive and more useful. A U.S.
      Justice Department investigation concluded in 1994 with a settlement in
      which Microsoft changed some sales practices that the government contended
      enabled the company to unfairly discourage OS customers from trying
      alternative programs. The following year the Justice Department
      successfully challenged Microsoft’s proposed purchase of Intuit Inc., then
      the leading maker of financial software for PCs.

    <h3>Chasing the Internet</h3>
    <p>
      Partly because of its stunning success in PC software, Microsoft was slow
      to realize the commercial possibilities of network systems and the
      Internet. In 1993 it released Windows NT, a landmark program that tied
      disparate PCs together and offered improved reliability and network
      security. Sales were initially disappointing, but by 1996 Windows NT was
      being hailed as the likely standard for PC networking, quickly surpassing
      Novell’s NetWare in market share. Microsoft did not move into Internet
      software until a new venture, Netscape Communications Corp., had
      introduced Navigator, a Web browser program that simplified the
      once-arcane process of navigating the World Wide Web. In a violent change
      of course, Microsoft quickly developed its own browser, Internet Explorer,
      made it free, and moved aggressively to persuade computer makers and
      Internet service providers to distribute it exclusively. By 1996 Microsoft
      was bundling Explorer with Windows OS and had begun the process of
      integrating Explorer directly into Windows. In response, Netscape accused
      Microsoft of violating its 1995 consent decree and sued; those efforts
      helped to persuade the Justice Department to reopen a broad investigation
      of Microsoft. In 1999, following a trial that lasted 30 months, a judge
      found Microsoft in violation of the Sherman Antitrust Act (1890) and
      ordered the breakup of the company. In 2001 an appeals court overturned
      the breakup order but still found the company guilty of illegally trying
      to maintain a monopoly. The company’s legal woes continued in 2004: the
      European Union (EU) levied the largest fine in the organization’s history
      to that point, €497.2 million ($611 million), in retaliation for what were
      described as Microsoft’s near-monopoly practices. In February 2008 the EU
      imposed an even higher fine, €899 million ($1.35 billion), on the company
      for having defied the EU’s 2004 antitrust decision against Microsoft for
      illegally bundling multimedia software with its Windows operating system
      to the exclusion of competitors.

    <h3>Entry into the gaming and mobile phone markets</h3>
    <p>
      In 2001 Microsoft released the Xbox, an electronic game console that
      quickly captured second place in the video gaming market. In 2002 it
      launched Xbox Live, a broadband gaming network for its consoles. A more
      powerful gaming console, the Xbox 360, was released in 2005. In an
      intensely competitive market, where the Xbox faced strong pressure from
      the Nintendo Wii and Sony PlayStation, Microsoft struggled through the
      years to make consistent profits from its console. For example, in 2009
      the company cut the price of the Xbox 360 Elite by as much as 25 percent
      in order to pick up market share. The move was successful; by 2010 the
      Xbox 360 was the most-used game console in the American home. But at the
      same time, the price cuts also led to a 6 percent drop in revenue in
      Microsoft’s Entertainment and Devices Division (EDD). The Xbox 360 was
      succeeded in 2013 by the Xbox One, which in turn was replaced by Xbox
      Series X and Xbox Series S in 2020.Other EDD products also struggled. The
      Zune family of portable media players introduced in 2006 failed to
      challenge the market dominance of Apple’s iPod, and it was discontinued in
      2011. The Windows Mobile OS, used in smartphones made by a variety of
      vendors, including HTC, LG, Motorola, and Samsung, trailed in market share
      in the United States behind Research in Motion’s BlackBerry and Apple’s
      iPhone. In 2009 Microsoft ceased publishing online and disc versions of
      its Encarta encyclopaedia.

    <h3>Further developments in Windows OS</h3>
    <p>
      Microsoft began planning a major replacement for all of its operating
      systems in 2001. The project, code-named Longhorn, encountered numerous
      delays, in part because of efforts to address the public’s growing concern
      with computer security and consumers’ desire for PCs to have greater
      integration with a full range of entertainment equipment within the modern
      electronic home. The company started over, and the new operating system,
      renamed Vista, was released to other software developers late in 2006 and
      to the general public in 2007. Like most new operating systems, Vista met
      with initial problems involving incompatibilities with older computer
      peripherals. More problematic for the new operating system was its
      “bloated” structure, which required a very fast microprocessor and large
      amounts of dedicated computer memory for proper functioning. Its high
      threshold for adequate system resources deterred many companies and
      individuals from upgrading systems from earlier, and perfectly
      serviceable, systems such as Windows XP (derived from the term Windows
      Experience). In addition, consumers were baffled by the numerous Vista
      options—Home (Basic or Premium), Ultimate, Business, and others—while
      business users (Microsoft’s core market) balked at its major change to the
      user interface and were unwilling to port their internal applications to
      the new system. Microsoft’s corporate users had other reasons to stick
      with Windows XP. Though still problematic compared with other operating
      systems, XP was significantly more secure than its predecessors. XP was
      also faster and much more stable than Windows 95 or 98, and it ran tens of
      thousands of software programs written specifically for it, which made
      business users reluctant to switch operating systems. It can be argued
      that customer satisfaction with XP is what killed Vista among business
      users. PC makers, who were contractually required by Microsoft to ship
      products with Vista, were compelled to offer “downgrades” from Vista to
      XP, and user appreciation even compelled Microsoft to extend its official
      support of the older OS through 2014, three years beyond its normal
      support policies. Adding to Microsoft’s OS problems was increased
      competition in the marketplace. Apple’s Mac OS X, riding on the huge
      success of the iPhone and iPod consumer products, grew in popularity.
      Linux, long an operating system for the technically adept, began to appear
      in more user-friendly versions, such as Ubuntu, and by the end of the
      first decade of the 21st century, Linux had captured one-third of the
      growing low-cost netbook market. Yet, despite its problems in the
      marketplace, Microsoft remained the dominant supplier of operating
      systems. Windows held a worldwide market share of 86 to 92 percent,
      depending on the research analysis. With the release in 2009 of Windows 7,
      the replacement for Vista, to critical praise by reviewers and analysts,
      Microsoft’s lead remained intact. In 2012 the company released Windows 8,
      which offered a start screen with applications appearing as tiles on a
      grid. Windows 10, released in 2015, featured Cortana, a digital personal
      assistant capable of responding to voice commands (as did the iPhone’s
      Siri), and a new Web browser, Microsoft Edge, which replaced Internet
      Explorer.

    <h3>Competition with Google</h3>
    <p>
      Microsoft’s continued OS dominance and its quick recovery in the “browser
      wars” did not repeat itself in the search-engine market, where Microsoft’s
      search engine, Live Search, trailed well behind those of Google Inc., the
      new industry giant, and Yahoo! Inc., the durable Internet portal site.
      Microsoft hoped to change the market dynamics with the release in 2009 of
      Bing, a “decision engine” designed to display more retrieved information
      in search pages than was typical, thus enabling better-informed decisions
      concerning what links to follow or, in some cases, displaying enough
      information to satisfy the original query. In 2008 Microsoft had offered
      to buy Yahoo! for $44.6 billion, but this proposal was rejected by Yahoo!
      However, negotiations between the companies continued, and in 2009 an
      agreement was reached in which Yahoo! would use Bing for its Web site and
      would handle premium advertisements for Microsoft’s Web site. The deal was
      continued with some modifications (giving more flexibility to Yahoo!) in
      2015. Microsoft followed up the agreement with Yahoo! by licensing search
      content from Wolfram Research, makers of the Mathematica-powered
      WolframAlpha scientific search engine. On another front in its competition
      with Google, Microsoft moved into cloud computing, where application
      software and data storage are provided by centralized Internet services
      and are simply accessed by users through their local PCs. Microsoft’s
      first move was with its Windows Azure (since 2014, Microsoft Azure)
      platform, announced in 2008 and launched in 2010. Azure lets service
      providers or businesses build computing infrastructure in the “cloud” and
      then offer the infrastructure as services to users. In 2011 Microsoft
      released Office 365, a cloud version of its highly profitable Office
      business software suite (comprising Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook, and
      OneNote) that included services and features similar to those of Google
      Docs. In 2011 Microsoft bought the Internet voice communication company
      Skype for $8.5 billion, which at that time was the largest acquisition in
      Microsoft’s history. Microsoft added Skype to Xbox, Outlook, and Windows
      smartphones. The Skype acquisition placed Microsoft in competition with
      Apple’s video-chat service FaceTime and Google’s Internet communication
      service Voice. In 2016 Microsoft made an even larger acquisition with its
      $26.2 billion purchase of the career-focused social networking company
      LinkedIn.

    <hr />
    <h3>Microsoft after Bill Gates</h3>
    <p>
      In 2000 company cofounder Gates relinquished his role as CEO of Microsoft
      to Steve Ballmer, whom Gates had met during his brief tenure at Harvard
      University in the 1970s. He handed over the title of chief software
      architect in 2006 to Ray Ozzie, a chief developer of the computer
      networking package Lotus Notes in the 1990s. In 2008 Gates left the
      day-to-day running of the company to Ballmer, Ozzie, and other managers,
      though he remained as chairman of the board. Ozzie stepped down in 2010,
      and longtime Microsoft executive Satya Nadella replaced Ballmer as CEO in
      2014. There was some concern (and some hopefulness) among industry
      observers that the departure of Gates would hamper Microsoft’s preeminent
      position in the computer industry. That situation did not materialize. The
      company retained its top spot in both business and consumer segments,
      including operating systems, productivity software, and online gaming
      services. In 2012 it introduced Surface, a line of hybrid tablet computers
      with hardware designed by Microsoft itself, a first for the company. It
      also had competitive products in almost all areas of business information
      technology and applications. Microsoft’s core strengths and most of its
      profits were to be found on its business side, where it set global
      standards with its products. Nevertheless, Microsoft’s management
      understood that the company also had to have a major, even if not a
      dominant, presence in consumer markets as improvements in information
      technology continued to blur the line between personal computing and
      business computing. Encarta, in full Microsoft Encarta Multimedia
      Encyclopedia, multimedia digital encyclopaedia produced by Microsoft
      Corporation (1993–2009). Initially a CD-ROM product, the Encarta brand
      later expanded to include an Internet-based incarnation and was bundled
      with other Microsoft products. The possibility of a digital encyclopaedia
      was first discussed at Microsoft in 1985. The company approached a range
      of reference publishers before signing a nonexclusive contract with Funk &
      Wagnalls to use their 29-volume New Encyclopedia in establishing a
      database in 1989. The project, however, was put on hold in 1990 due to
      concerns about the commercial viability of the product. After efforts
      resumed in 1991, the company proceeded to illustrate the approximately
      25,000 articles using an array of sound files and maps as well as more
      than 5,000 public domain images and a small selection of videos.
      Approximately 40 percent of the articles were biographies. Additional
      features included a time line of human history, a dictionary and
      thesaurus, and a quiz game called MindMaze. The encyclopaedia was later
      offered in a range of foreign-language and regionally specific editions.
      The initial CD product was released in March 1993 with a retail price of
      nearly $400, equivalent to such competitors as Compton’s MultiMedia
      Encyclopedia. Following slow sales, later that year the CD was given away
      with the Windows software suite that was included with the purchase of
      many computers, and the stand-alone price was dropped to $99. The price
      reduction effectively catalyzed sales that outstripped competitors. Prices
      continued to drop throughout the product’s life span. Abbreviated versions
      of some Encarta articles were available to subscribers to the Microsoft
      Network ISP, launched in 1995. Beginning in 1996, Encarta CDs were issued
      in standard and deluxe editions. Users of the deluxe edition, which had
      twice the multimedia content offered by the standard edition, could also
      download monthly updates from Microsoft; users of the standard edition
      could do so for a fee. Encarta was offered in a bundled reference suite
      edition, which included a reference library and an interactive atlas,
      beginning in 1997; it also remained available as a stand-alone product. In
      1998 Microsoft purchased the copyrights to Collier’s electronic
      encyclopaedia and the New Merit Scholar’s Encyclopedia and incorporated
      that material into Encarta. In 1999 the company debuted the Encarta
      Africana, an encyclopaedia of black history that was the result of a
      collaboration with scholars, including Henry Louis Gates, Jr., and
      published a print and digital dictionary, the Encarta World English
      Dictionary, called the Encarta Webster’s Dictionary of the English
      Language in subsequent editions. A subscription Web site debuted in 1998,
      and an abridged version of Encarta was made available online for free in

      Microsoft began charging for access to all encyclopaedia content the
      following year, though access to dictionary content remained free. In 2006
      maintenance of Encarta content was turned over to Websters Multimedia
      Inc., a subsidiary of Websters International Publishers Ltd. Citing the
      advent of free online reference sources, Microsoft discontinued Encarta,
      which then consisted of more than 60,000 articles, at the end of 2009.
      Only the free Encarta dictionary remained online.

    <h3>operating system</h3>
    <p>
      operating system (OS), program that manages a computer’s resources,
      especially the allocation of those resources among other programs. Typical
      resources include the central processing unit (CPU), computer memory, file
      storage, input/output (I/O) devices, and network connections. Management
      tasks include scheduling resource use to avoid conflicts and interference
      between programs. Unlike most programs, which complete a task and
      terminate, an operating system runs indefinitely and terminates only when
      the computer is turned off. Modern multiprocessing operating systems allow
      many processes to be active, where each process is a “thread” of
      computation being used to execute a program. One form of multiprocessing
      is called time-sharing, which lets many users share computer access by
      rapidly switching between them. Time-sharing must guard against
      interference between users’ programs, and most systems use virtual memory,
      in which the memory, or “address space,” used by a program may reside in
      secondary memory (such as on a magnetic hard disk drive) when not in
      immediate use, to be swapped back to occupy the faster main computer
      memory on demand. This virtual memory both increases the address space
      available to a program and helps to prevent programs from interfering with
      each other, but it requires careful control by the operating system and a
      set of allocation tables to keep track of memory use. Perhaps the most
      delicate and critical task for a modern operating system is allocation of
      the CPU; each process is allowed to use the CPU for a limited time, which
      may be a fraction of a second, and then must give up control and become
      suspended until its next turn. Switching between processes must itself use
      the CPU while protecting all data of the processes. The first digital
      computers had no operating systems. They ran one program at a time, which
      had command of all system resources, and a human operator would provide
      any special resources needed. The first operating systems were developed
      in the mid-1950s. These were small “supervisor programs” that provided
      basic I/O operations (such as controlling punch card readers and printers)
      and kept accounts of CPU usage for billing. Supervisor programs also
      provided multiprogramming capabilities to enable several programs to run
      at once. This was particularly important so that these early
      multimillion-dollar machines would not be idle during slow I/O operations.
      Computers acquired more powerful operating systems in the 1960s with the
      emergence of time-sharing, which required a system to manage multiple
      users sharing CPU time and terminals. Two early time-sharing systems were
      CTSS (Compatible Time Sharing System), developed at the Massachusetts
      Institute of Technology, and the Dartmouth College Basic System, developed
      at Dartmouth College. Other multiprogrammed systems included Atlas, at the
      University of Manchester, England, and IBM’s OS/360, probably the most
      complex software package of the 1960s. After 1972 the Multics system for
      General Electric Co.’s GE 645 computer (and later for Honeywell Inc.’s
      computers) became the most sophisticated system, with most of the
      multiprogramming and time-sharing capabilities that later became standard.
      The minicomputers of the 1970s had limited memory and required smaller
      operating systems. The most important operating system of that period was
      UNIX, developed by AT&T for large minicomputers as a simpler alternative
      to Multics. It became widely used in the 1980s, in part because it was
      free to universities and in part because it was designed with a set of
      tools that were powerful in the hands of skilled programmers. More
      recently, Linux, an open-source version of UNIX developed in part by a
      group led by Finnish computer science student Linus Torvalds and in part
      by a group led by American computer programmer Richard Stallman, has
      become popular on personal computers as well as on larger computers. In
      addition to such general-purpose systems, special-purpose operating
      systems run on small computers that control assembly lines, aircraft, and
      even home appliances. They are real-time systems, designed to provide
      rapid response to sensors and to use their inputs to control machinery.
      Operating systems have also been developed for mobile devices such as
      smartphones and tablets. Apple Inc.’s iOS, which runs on iPhones and
      iPads, and Google Inc.’s Android are two prominent mobile operating
      systems. From the standpoint of a user or an application program, an
      operating system provides services. Some of these are simple user commands
      like “dir”—show the files on a disk—while others are low-level “system
      calls” that a graphics program might use to display an image. In either
      case the operating system provides appropriate access to its objects, the
      tables of disk locations in one case and the routines to transfer data to
      the screen in the other. Some of its routines, those that manage the CPU
      and memory, are generally accessible only to other portions of the
      operating system. Contemporary operating systems for personal computers
      commonly provide a graphical user interface (GUI). The GUI may be an
      intrinsic part of the system, as in the older versions of Apple’s Mac OS
      and Microsoft Corporation’s Windows OS; in others it is a set of programs
      that depend on an underlying system, as in the X Window system for UNIX
      and Apple’s Mac OS X. Operating systems also provide network services and
      file-sharing capabilities—even the ability to share resources between
      systems of different types, such as Windows and UNIX. Such sharing has
      become feasible through the introduction of network protocols
      (communication rules) such as the Internet’s TCP/IP.

    <h2>Mobile telephone</h2>
    <p>
      Mobile telephone, also called mobile phone, portable device for connecting
      to a telecommunications network in order to transmit and receive voice,
      video, or other data. Mobile phones typically connect to the public
      switched telephone network (PSTN) through one of two categories: cellular
      telephone systems or global satellite-based telephony.

    <h3>Cellular telephones</h3>
    <p>
      Cellular telephones, or simply cell phones, are portable devices that may
      be used in motor vehicles or by pedestrians. Communicating by radio waves,
      they permit a significant degree of mobility within a defined serving
      region that may range in area from a few city blocks to hundreds of square
      kilometres. The first mobile and portable subscriber units for cellular
      systems were large and heavy. With significant advances in component
      technology, though, the weight and size of portable transceivers have been
      significantly reduced. In this section, the concept of cell phones and the
      development of cellular systems are discussed.

        station serving that cell to the mobile telephone switching office
        (MTSO). The MTSO in turn

        a central office in

        the public switched telephone network. When telephone traffic within a
        cell exceeds capacity,
        <br />
        the cell is split into a number of smaller cells, each with its own base
        station.
